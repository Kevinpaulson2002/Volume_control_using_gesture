# Volume_control_using_gesture
his project uses computer vision and automation libraries to control system volume through hand gestures. By leveraging a webcam, the program captures real-time video and processes the image to detect hand movements. It adjusts the system volume based on the vertical position of the hand within a predefined region of interest (ROI).
